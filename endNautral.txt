You know what you have to do- the girl needs to disappear from this world. She's slowly losing control, she can't stay here. 
"I don't want to go" the girl crossed her arm and pouted at you "I want to stay and play"
There is no other choice. If she doesn't come back to the world of the dead, you have to send her there yourself
You grabbed your iron knife and hold it really tight. The moment the ghost turned around it was all over.
Only a faint scream could be heard in the air. 
It could have ended in much more pleasant way, but at least it ended already. 

You reached a neutral ending. Congratulations!
