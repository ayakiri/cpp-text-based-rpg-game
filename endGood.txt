You know what you have to do- the girl needs to disappear from this world. She's slowly losing control, she can't stay here. 
Just as you were thinking about everything that you heard, you touched a small wooden figure in your pocket.
"There is someone waiting for you" you kneeled next to a girl and showed her figure.
"A horse from uncle Broderick! I don't have a horse yet!" the girl looked pretty excited as she saw the figure "have you meet uncle? Can I meet uncle?"
"Sure. Shall we go to him together?" you reach out your hand toward the girl as she smiled brightly.
...
The girl ran into Broderick's arms as soon as she saw him.
"Little princess, are you ready to go?" girl's uncle catched her and patted her head.
"Yes! Let's go uncle" the girl started to cry, but they weren't sad tears.
"Let's go together, little Aurora" the uncle smiled and closed his eyes.
As the girl slowly faded away, the uncle's grip on her became weaker as well as his breathing. And in couple of seconds they, both of them, were gone from this world. 
Hopefully they are playing hide and seek somwhere else. 

You reached a good ending. Congratulations!
