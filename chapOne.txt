Getting nearer to the palace turned out to be much more stressful than you have previously assumed. Or maybe it wasn’t a journey that was stressful, but rather what awaited you at the end. Couple of weeks ago you received a letter. A letter from none other than a king himself!  But what was it about? That’s what you were about to find out, because the letter didn’t explain it - just that it was urgent. As you get closer to your destination you decide to look around. 
1: Examine a bakery
2: Go to the tailor

Encouraged by the sweet smell of baked pies you walk straight to the local bakery. Apple pies, bagels, cakes, tarts, loafs - just everything your heart can desire. “See anything you like?” a deep female voice asked, just from behind your shoulders. “You don’t look like you are from here? Are you travelling, sweetheart?” said the woman. 
1: “I got summoned by a king.”
2: “I have some business around.”
3: Say nothing

“A KING?" woman looked at you, as if she had to find at least a small proof of your words. “As they say, you should not judge a book by it’s cover...ANYWAY! You can’t walk around hungry if you are summoned BY A KING HIMSELF!” woman continued her monologue, getting more excited with every passing second. “Here, take this! I know, I’m awesome, but no need to thank me, just make sure to enjoy it, sweetie! Come on, don’t let THE KING wait”

“Not much of a talker, are you? If you see anything you like just tell me” the woman stated, pointing to shelves full of pies. As nothing catches your eye, you turn around and leave.

A small and old looking tailor shop catches your eye instantly. In just a short while you found yourself staring at unusual garments. “Don’t you dare steal a single thing, tourist!” a grumpy voice from behind you warned you. It looks like it belongs to the shop owner - and the only other person in the room right now. 
1: “Well, nobody will see a thing, right? Or do you think YOU can stop me?”
2: “What? I’m not here to steal… I was just admiring this piece of art”
3: “I’m just looking around”

a“Y-You! I will call for help! Leave my shop right now!” the old man, visibly panicked, ran behind a counter and grabbed a broom. No longer being welcome, you turn around and leave the shop - with a smirk on your face.

“...a-art?” the owner whispered and turned his face to the side. Was it just your imagination or the old man is blushing? “WELL! As someone who acknowledged my masterpiece, you deserved to be rewarded. Take it and don’t hurt my eyes anymore with those clothes of yours!” said the man, still blushing. Looking at an old man’s hand you see a shiny scarf.

“Then look faster! Don’t you have a job to do or places to be?! The Younger generation never think about the future!” the owner started murmuring under his breath for a while, and - not wanting to face any more of his grumpiness, you left the store.
