Gravel path lead straight to a crossroad with a signpost. One sign, labeld "To the mountain", points to a bridge. Second one, with just a word "Pond", points to a little pond in the distance.  Third one, with "To the castle" label, points to the huge meadow. The last sign is completely illegible due to it being destroyed, however it pointed to an ever thicker part of the forest.

You sat at the bank of the pond. It is really nice to take a short breath for a second. The birds are singing, the sun is so warm. When you turn around you see a beautiful woman behind you. "Hello wanderer, aren't you tired from your journey?" the woman spoke to you with a heavenly voice "I like people who knows how to enjoy nature, I can help you if you want". "Who are you?" you ask, but somehow you aren't nervous around her, even though she is a complete stranger. "I am the Lady of this Forest. I take care of it, of every being that visits my home, no matter how small or how big" the Lady explained "would you like to heal your wounds? I can help with those"

"Oh, Aurora!" the man looked pleased as you asked this question "The little princess Aurora. She is beautiful and caring and kind and smart. The best daughter anyone could have." The man looked at the castle silhouette in the far away "she is the king's daughter and I am the one responsible for her safety" You looked at the man for a second. As far as you knew the king does not have any children. Were you not informed right? Or did the man was just telling some stories he made up?
1: "Where is Aurora now?"
