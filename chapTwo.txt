Entering a main hall in palace you find yourself in a corridor with three doors. Left doors looking pretty casual, with no special decors, while right ones seemed to be in a worse state, with possibly a claw marks all over them? Only front doors look like thay actually belongs to a castle - with plenty gold ornaments and beautiful cravings.

You walk through left side doors. Looking inside you find some kind of storeroom. Most of the items there were of no special use, but three of them looks kinda useful. What catches your eye is a small jar of leeches, candles and kitchen knife.  
1: Take the jar of leeches
2: Take candles
3: Take kitchen knife
4: Take all 3 items

"What are you doing here!" you hear some high-pitched voice behind you, just as you are putting some items into your bag. "Leave those things, righ now! And leave the room! Or this castle! Or this city! Or this--" seeing no end to woman's screams you leave the room.

You turn right and open the doors with a creaking sound. The room looks pretty abandoned, which looks weird, given the fact that it was a room in a king's palace.  You are going further and further as you realise that there is no intresting thing here. You turn around and try to leave the room, when you realise the doors are not here. Instead there is a pale looking woman crying on the floor. 
1: Look for the exit
2: Confront the woman

Not wanting to disturb castle residents you turn around to look for the exit. It has to be somewhere, doesn't it? But just as you are trying to walk away you feel a cold arm on your shoulder. "C-can you help m-me?" the voice started to sound more and more devilish. "I don't think I can--" your explantion is being interupted as the creature jumped high into air and bite into your neck.

"Hello?" you ask with not an inch of confidence "may I help you?". Woman looks at you for a short while before turning away. "Yes, yes you can" you hear her saying. "Nice, what can I--" you try to gather more information as the starts to transform into some devilish creature. "You can help me by giving my your blood!"

As the fight ends, you breathe a sigh of relieve. What was it? A vampire? A ghoul? Whatever it was it is gone now. The moment strange creature disappeared, you find out that the doors you were looking for, were in the same spot as when you entered the room.

Walking proudly through the front doors you enter the lavish looking hall - and at the center of it was standing no other than a king himself. "Ah, there you are!" king's face visibly brightened with relieve. "You must be this famous ghost catcher. You have to help me. Me and my people" king is visibly overwhelmed with emotions "this ghost is haunting kingdom and we can't take this anymore. You have to get rid of it right now!"
1: "Where did the ghost came from?"
2: "Who is this ghost?"
3: "Where can I find it?"

"Then what are you still doing here?! You need to get rid of it right now" king's patience was clearly running thin. "Go to the armory, it's located in the lower city, turn right when you leave the castle. People there will give you some things that might be useful to you. And stop standing there! Go!"

Aaaand a deadend. You find nothing here. Nothing except for a big guy with an even bigger sword. You could have sworn he wasn't there the second ago! The guy got pretty huge muscles, an eyepatch on the left eye and really, really mean look on his face.

"So hello?" maybe not the best choice but it was the first thing that you came up with. "Mogak want drink. Mogak want beer. Mogak want money" the guy finally speaks. To your bad luck and empty pockets that request was clearly out of limits. But maybe attacking him now won't be the worst idea as he seems kinda lost in thoughts?

You are doing pretty well until you look past the corner - "Hey, are you trying to run away?" - some other man showed up, "are you trying to run away from our dear Mogak?" You glance at the first guy and he looks pretty pissed right now. "Mogak mad. Mogak want FIGHT!"

Armory looked like... an armory. Big, spacious and full of weapons and sweaty soldiers. "Are you this ghost hunter send by the king?" tall guy asked, he looks like one of the generals. "Yes, I am" you answer proudly.

"I will show you a 3 sets of things, but from every one you can only take one item. I am not sure what you will need as every item may be usefull in different situation" I should probably think careful about this one.

"Okay, here goes the first pack" the man showed you a couple of things, but only three of them caught your attention. "Excelent choice. Grappling hook, perfect for climbing up the walls. Pirate sword, curvy sword with a thick blade, might be usefull for a couple things, like slashing plants or slashing enemies or slashing in general. And the last one - torch, irreplaceable when exploring mines or other caves"

"And now we have a couple of potions" the man pointed to an alchemist stand "I selected these three as the most usefull ones. Potion of luck, pretty much self explanatory, but remember it is illegal to drink it when you gamble! Potion of sun, though you might think otherwise, it is actually useful when traveling in a hot enviroment, like a desert. Potion of darkness, pour it on someone and you will be sure that they won't see a single thing in a long time, but for the love of a king, don't drink it yourself!"

"This is the last set" the man opened a small bag and immediately three things caught your eye. "You are a true adventurer! Though I am slightly concerned about your choices. This strange sugar... we confiscated it from some foreigners, it's an illegal substance, but if you REALLY need it you can take it. Lucky coin, always shows the side you want it to show, again, not fully legal in our city. And the last one is a cross, might come in handy if you encounter some vampires or... vampires"
